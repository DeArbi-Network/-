# System Architecture

## Overview
The DeArbi Network architecture is designed for scalability, transparency, and efficiency. It integrates AI-driven decision-making with blockchain-based execution.

### Components

1. **Agents Module (`agents/`):**
   - Contains AI agents for arbitrage decision-making.
   - Integrates with market data APIs and executes trades.

2. **Contracts Module (`contracts/`):**
   - Smart contracts written in Solidity.
   - Includes $ARBOT token and arbitrage execution logic.

3. **Frontend Module (`frontend/`):**
   - A React-based interface for monitoring and controlling arbitrage strategies.

4. **Data Module (`data/`):**
   - Manages raw and processed market data for analysis.

5. **Scripts Module (`scripts/`):**
   - Contains utility scripts for automation and deployment.

### Workflow
1. Market data is collected and processed.
2. AI agents analyze data for arbitrage opportunities.
3. Trades are executed via smart contracts.
4. Results are displayed in the frontend for transparency.
